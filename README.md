# Release Notes

### Patch 0.1
Following areas are curated for #feature-list:
	- Databases
	- OSdev
	- Hypervisors & Virtualization: building a VM orchestrator that takes a bare metal GPU cluster and turns it into Amazon EC2instance and sandboxing containers with a gVisor clone.
	- Fuzzers
	- Containers & Networking: devloping your own customer runtime.  
	- Browser engines: something like Servo, a web rendering engine written in Rust, with WebGL and WebGPU support.  
	- CLI Tools: something like Distill CLI that leverages Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Bedrock to generate summaries of audio recordings directly from the command line [ Werner Vogels(CTO of Amazon)'s personal project] and CLI for controlling network traffic with eBPF.
	- Emulators: building a GameBoy Advanced emulator for the web. 
	- File Systems: designing a custom content-addressed file system that is similar to BTRFS in performance.
	- Compiler contributions & Tooling: Contributing to the Roc programming language & building a super-fast typeScript/javaScript compiler like SWC.
	- Concurrency & Parallelism
	- Performance engineering
	- Search Engines: something related to meilisearch, a powerful open-source search engine. 
	- WebAssembly
	- Async
	- Web servers: building a powerful global cache 

Random Projects, Toy Implementation, and Open source contributions will be done in the above areas. It servers as a starting point to get a good idea on all things systems.
