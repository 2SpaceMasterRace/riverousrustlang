# Release Notes

### Patch 0.1
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Following areas are curated for [#feature-list]:

1. ```Hypervisors & Virtualization``` : building a VM orchestrator that takes a bare metal GPU cluster and turns it into Amazon EC2 instance and sandboxing containers with a gVisor clone.
2. ```Fuzzers``` : build a structure-aware and feedback-driven fuzzing engine for rust funcitons similar to Fuzzcheck.
3. ```Containers & Networking```: devloping your own customer runtime and CLI for controlling network traffic with eBPF
4. ```Browser engines``` : writing a web rendering engine with WebGL and WebGPU support like Servo.
5. ```Emulators``` : build a full-fledged GameBoy Advanced emulator for the web.
6. ```Compiler contributions & Tooling``` : Contributing to the Roc programming language & building a super-fast typeScript/javaScript compiler like SWC.
7. ```Search Engines``` : write a mini but powerful open-source search engine similar to Meilisearch.

random projects, toy implementation, and open source contributions will be done in the above areas. will be integrating this with the PING-CAP talent plan soon in the future
